## Success is a Journey
The road to success is always under construction.  THere is no end game in success.  Customer success is a never ending journey that continues as long as the customer is with you.  A set of milestones.  Your job is to help every customer acheive their definition of success.  Predictable success leads to predictable revenue.  Aaron Ross - sales pipeline revenue generation.  Don't want success to be random or luck, etc.  

How do we make succes more repeatable.  We use success plans.

Success plans are a journey like a road trip.  The driver is your customer and you are in the passenger seat.  You don't control the car like steerint, gas, braking... Your job is to help them get to their destination.  Plan a route and help them to do that.  Define milestones on the journey.  The cities they will travel through.  How do they want to go on this journey - secnic route vs fastest route   Help them to think about this journey.  When do they get gas or food or rest.  Help them plan this and it will seem natural journey


Journey Planning:
1. Identify where your customer is at today.  Where is the customer starting from...
2. Clarify where they want to get to.  What does success utlimately look like
3. Identify when they want to get there.  How quickly do they want to acheive the outcome/value.  Fast or slow.  THis will depend on business priorities and any constraints
4. Layout how they want to get there.  Some customers have a higher tolerance for more risks (errors).  Some customers want to minimize risks.
